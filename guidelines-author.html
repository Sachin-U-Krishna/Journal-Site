            <!-- Guidelines for author -->
            <h3 class="text-style">Guidelines for reviewers</h3>
            <p class="para">The Journal of Intelligent Systems and Computing (JISCOM) aims at publication of original
                research articles, survey articles, review articles, case studies and book reviews etc. mainly of
                intelligent systems, computing and related areas.</p>

            <!-- The articles should strictly follow the guidelines mentioned on the Journal webpage for specific article type. -->

            <h4>Research articles</h4>
            <p class="para">Research articles should present the results of an original research study. These
                manuscripts should describe how the research was conducted and provide a thorough analysis of the
                results of the research. The research article format is suitable for many different fields and different
                types of studies. It includes full Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion sections.</p>

            <h4>Survey articles</h4>
            <p class="para">Survey focuses on data collection methods for large scale surveys, but papers on special
                populations are welcome. Papers on experiments, or papers based on data from non-probability samples are
                welcome given that authors undertake steps to assess external validity or limitations concerning
                population estimates in detail.</p>

            <h4>Review articles</h4>
            <p class="para">A review article provides an overview of the published literature in a particular subject
                area. Review Articles provide a comprehensive summary of research on a certain topic, and a perspective
                on the state of the field and where it is heading. Reviews are often widely read (for example, by
                researchers looking for a full introduction to a field) and highly cited. Reviews commonly cite
                approximately 50 primary research articles.</p>

            <h4>Case studies</h4>
            <p class="para">These articles report specific instances of interesting phenomena. A goal of Case Studies is
                to make other researchers aware of the possibility that a specific phenomenon might occur. Case studies
                help to provide a continual flow of effective up-to-date cases to promote excellence in research.</p>

            <h4>Book reviews</h4>
            <p class="para">Book reviews are published in most academic journals. The aim of a book review is to provide
                insight and opinion on recently published scholarly books. Book reviews are also relatively short
                articles and less time-consuming. Book reviews are a good publication option for early-career
                researchers as it allows the researcher to stay abreast of new literature in the field, while at the
                same time, adding to his publication list.
                <br /><br />
